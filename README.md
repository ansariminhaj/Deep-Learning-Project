# Deep-Learning-Project

Dataset cannot be uploaded due to privacy liability of medical images. The files are loaded from jupyter notebook and each block of code is preceded with a heading explaining it's purpose.

The dataset is a folder containing .nrrd files of CT images.

The code starts from 2d_cnn_preprocessing.py which handles all the preprocessing and classing (metastatic and non metastatic) of cropped lymph nodes.
The 2dcnn_new contains the model that is trained on the preprocessed data.
